    "Peaceful form, lying on a serpent, lotus-naveled, Lord of gods,",
    "Support of the universe, sky-colored, cloud-colored, auspicious-bodied,",
    "Consort of Lakshmi, lotus-eyed, attainable by yogis in meditation,",
    "I salute Vishnu, remover of worldly fear, the sole Lord of all worlds."
