        title: "Does Understanding the Meaning of a Mantra Matter While Chanting?",
        intro: "Meaning feels secondary, sometimes even irrelevant. The assumption is that repetition itself is doing the work.",
        description: "This question usually doesn’t come up on day one. When people start chanting a mantra, they’re mostly focused on getting the words right, remembering the sequence, maybe keeping count. But after some time, almost everyone notices something. The chanting continues, but attention doesn’t always follow.",

For example, chanting the <a href='/mantra/om-namah-shivaya' style='color:#f97316; text-decoration:underline;'>Om Namah Shivaya</a> regulates breathing, but meaning doesn’t replace sound.

- Without sound, there is no chant. For instance, the resonance of the <a href='/mantra/gayatri-mantra' style='color:#f97316; text-decoration:underline;'>Gayatri Mantra</a> builds the foundation. Without meaning, the chant slowly loses coherence for the mind.
